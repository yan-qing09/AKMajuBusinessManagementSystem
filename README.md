# AKMaju Business Management System

## Project Setup Instructions

This project uses Composer to manage PHP dependencies.

### Requirements
- Composer installed globally on your system

### Installation Steps

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of this project.

3. Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

   This will create the `vendor/` folder and install all packages as listed in `composer.json` and `composer.lock`.

4. Make sure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) has access to the `vendor/` directory after it's created.
